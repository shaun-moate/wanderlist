## User Stories

### Create New Family Adventure

As a dad planning a family trip, I want to create a new trip with a title, dates, and basic notes, so that I can start organizing our family adventure in a meaningful way.

**Workflow:**
1. User clicks "Create New Trip" button
2. Enters trip title (e.g., "Summer Road Trip to Yellowstone")
3. Selects start and end dates
4. Adds basic notes about the trip purpose or expectations
5. Saves the trip and sees it appear in their dashboard

### Quick Trip Capture

As a busy parent, I want to quickly capture a trip idea when inspiration strikes, so that I don't lose spontaneous family adventure ideas.

**Workflow:**
1. User sees a "Quick Add Trip" button on the dashboard
2. Clicks it and gets a simplified form
3. Enters just the trip title
4. Optionally adds dates or notes
5. Trip is saved and can be expanded later

## Spec Scope

1. **Trip Creation Form** - Modal or page with fields for title, dates, and notes
2. **Basic Trip Card Display** - Simple card showing trip title, dates, and notes
3. **Dashboard Integration** - New trips appear on the main dashboard
4. **Form Validation** - Basic validation for required fields and date logic
5. **Local Data Storage** - Save trips to browser local storage

## Out of Scope

- Advanced trip features (packing lists, must-do items)
- Photo or sketch integration
- Trip status progression (Daydreams/Quests/Tales)
- Sharing or collaboration features
- Mobile-specific optimizations

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can create new trips through a clean, family-friendly form
2. Trip cards display essential information on the dashboard
3. Trips persist between browser sessions using local storage
4. Form provides helpful validation and error messages
