## Overview

Create a main dashboard that displays active trips organized by narrative stages (Daydreams, Quests, Tales) with visual progress indicators and quick action buttons for trip management, providing dads with an at-a-glance view of their family's travel planning journey.

## User Stories

### Family Trip Overview at a Glance

As a dad planning family trips, I want to see all my active trips organized by their current narrative stage, so that I can quickly understand where each trip stands in our family's adventure planning process.

**Detailed Workflow:** User opens the app and immediately sees a card-based dashboard showing trips grouped by Daydreams (planning phase), Quests (active planning), and Tales (completed trips). Each card shows the trip title, dates, and a visual progress indicator showing how far along the trip is in its narrative journey.

### Quick Trip Management Actions

As a busy parent, I want quick access to create new trips or edit existing ones directly from the dashboard, so that I can efficiently manage our travel plans without navigating through multiple screens.

**Detailed Workflow:** From the dashboard, user can tap a prominent "New Trip" button to start planning immediately, or tap any trip card to access edit mode. The interface provides contextual actions like "Mark as Quest" or "Complete Trip" based on the current stage.

### Visual Progress Tracking

As a dad who enjoys the storytelling aspect of travel planning, I want to see clear visual indicators of each trip's progress through the Daydreams → Quests → Tales journey, so that I can feel the narrative progression of our family adventures.

**Detailed Workflow:** Each trip card displays a progress bar or stage indicator showing current position (Daydream, Quest, or Tale), with smooth animations when trips move between stages. Completed trips show in a dedicated "Tales" section with memory-like styling.

## Spec Scope

1. **Trip Stage Organization** - Display trips grouped by Daydreams, Quests, and Tales stages with clear visual separation
2. **Progress Indicators** - Show visual progress bars or stage markers for each trip's narrative journey
3. **Quick Actions** - Provide prominent buttons for creating new trips and editing existing ones
4. **Card-Based Layout** - Use card components inspired by shadcn/ui blocks for trip display
5. **Responsive Design** - Ensure dashboard works well on both desktop and mobile devices

## Out of Scope

- Advanced filtering or search functionality
- Trip sharing or collaboration features
- Detailed trip statistics or analytics
- Integration with external calendar systems
- Photo or media display within cards

## Expected Deliverable

1. Dashboard page displaying trips organized by narrative stages with clear visual hierarchy
2. Functional progress indicators that update as trips move through stages
3. Working "New Trip" and "Edit Trip" buttons that navigate to appropriate forms
4. Card-based layout that matches shadcn/ui design patterns and is fully responsive</content>
