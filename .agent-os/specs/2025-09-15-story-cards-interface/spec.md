> Spec: Story Cards Interface
> Created: 2025-09-15

## Overview

Implement the story cards interface that enhances trip cards with narrative stage indicators (Daydreams, Quests, Tales) to create a storytelling progression for family travel planning. This feature transforms basic trip cards into visual story elements that guide users through the adventure lifecycle.

## User Stories

### Story Stage Display

As a dad planning family trips, I want to see each trip displayed as a story card with its current narrative stage, so that I can easily track the progression from initial idea to completed adventure.

Users can view their trips organized by stage, with clear visual indicators showing whether a trip is in the Daydream phase (planning), Quest phase (active travel), or Tale phase (completed memory).

### Stage Progression

As a user completing a trip, I want to advance my trip from Quest to Tale stage, so that I can mark adventures as completed and preserve them as family memories.

Users can click a button or indicator on the trip card to progress through stages, with confirmation for major transitions like completing a trip.

## Spec Scope

1. Stage Visual Indicators - Add colored borders, icons, and labels for each narrative stage
2. Stage Display Logic - Show current stage prominently on trip cards
3. Stage Progression Controls - Buttons or actions to advance trips through stages
4. Stage-based Organization - Group or filter trips by their current stage

## Out of Scope

- Advanced trip editing (dates, notes, title changes)
- Photo or sketch integration
- Trip deletion functionality
- Sharing or export features
- Complex animations or transitions

## Expected Deliverable

1. Trip cards display current narrative stage with appropriate visual styling
2. Users can advance trips through Daydreams → Quests → Tales progression
3. Dashboard provides clear stage-based organization of trips
4. Stage changes are persisted and reflected immediately in the UI
