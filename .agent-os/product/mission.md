# Product Mission

## Pitch

Wanderlist is a family travel planning app that helps dads organize trips by treating each journey like a chapter in their family's adventure book, providing a narrative-driven approach to travel planning rather than just moving cards around.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- Family Travel Planners: Dads and parents who want to organize family trips with a storytelling approach rather than corporate-style task management

### User Personas

**Dad of Two** (30-45 years old)
- **Role:** Family travel coordinator and adventure planner
- **Context:** Busy parent managing work, kids' schedules, and family vacations
- **Pain Points:** Travel planning feels like a chore, hard to maintain excitement, trips get forgotten in spreadsheets
- **Goals:** Create memorable family experiences, keep travel planning organized and fun, build family memories

## The Problem

### Disconnected Travel Planning

Family travel planning often feels like a corporate task list with boring "To Do/In Progress/Done" columns. Parents lose the magic and excitement of planning adventures when everything becomes just another checkbox.

**Our Solution:** Wanderlist transforms travel planning into a storytelling experience where each trip becomes a chapter in your family's adventure book.

### Forgotten Family Memories

Completed trips get buried in old spreadsheets or forgotten apps. There's no easy way to revisit past adventures and see how your family has grown through travel.

**Our Solution:** Memory Mode creates a timeline of completed trips, letting you flip back through your family's journey like pages in a book.

## Differentiators

### Narrative-Driven Planning

Unlike traditional todo apps like Todoist or Trello, Wanderlist frames travel planning as storytelling with "Daydreams," "Quests," and "Tales" instead of boring status columns. This creates emotional investment and excitement around family travel.

### Family Memory Archive

Unlike photo apps or basic travel trackers, Wanderlist builds a chronological story of your family's adventures, preserving not just photos but the planning process, challenges overcome, and reflections that make each trip meaningful.

## Key Features
