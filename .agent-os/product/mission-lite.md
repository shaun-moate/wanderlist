# Product Mission (Lite)

Wanderlist is a family travel planning app that helps dads organize trips by treating each journey like a chapter in their family's adventure book, providing a narrative-driven approach to travel planning rather than just moving cards around.

Wanderlist serves dads and parents who want to transform travel planning from a chore into an exciting storytelling experience. Unlike traditional todo apps, Wanderlist uses "Daydreams," "Quests," and "Tales" to create emotional investment in family adventures, while Memory Mode preserves completed trips as a chronological family archive.
