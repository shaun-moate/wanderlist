# Agent OS - OpenCode Integration

This project uses Agent OS standards and workflows to provide structured guidance for AI coding agents.

## Project Standards

The following standards and instructions are available in `.agent-os/`:

### Development Standards
- **Tech Stack**: Defined technologies, frameworks, and architecture decisions
- **Code Style**: Language-specific formatting, naming, and structure guidelines
- **Best Practices**: Quality standards, testing approaches, and development workflows

### Core Instructions
- **Plan Product**: Set mission & roadmap for new products
- **Analyze Product**: Understand existing codebases and establish development context
- **Create Spec**: Generate detailed feature specifications
- **Execute Tasks**: Implement features following established patterns
- **Post-Execution**: Quality checks and cleanup procedures

## Usage with OpenCode

When working on this project with OpenCode:

1. **Reference Standards**: Always check `.agent-os/standards/` for:
   - Technology decisions in `tech-stack.md`
   - Code formatting rules in `code-style.md`
   - Quality guidelines in `best-practices.md`

2. **Follow Workflows**: Use structured approaches from `.agent-os/instructions/core/`:
   - Start new features with spec creation
   - Implement following established patterns
   - Run post-execution quality checks

3. **Maintain Consistency**:
   - Match existing code style and patterns
   - Follow the defined tech stack
   - Apply project-specific best practices

## Available Specialized Agents

The following specialized agents are available for complex workflows:

### context-fetcher
**Purpose**: Use proactively to retrieve and extract relevant information from Agent OS documentation files. Checks if content is already in context before returning.
**Available Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob

### date-checker
**Purpose**: Use proactively to determine and output today's date including the current year, month and day. Checks if content is already in context before returning.
**Available Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob

### file-creator
**Purpose**: Use proactively to create files, directories, and apply templates for Agent OS workflows. Handles batch file creation with proper structure and boilerplate.
**Available Tools**: Write, Bash, Read

### git-workflow
**Purpose**: Use proactively to handle git operations, branch management, commits, and PR creation for Agent OS workflows
**Available Tools**: Bash, Read, Grep

### project-manager
**Purpose**: Use proactively to check task completeness and update task and roadmap tracking docs.
**Available Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, Write, Bash

### test-runner
**Purpose**: Use proactively to run tests and analyze failures for the current task. Returns detailed failure analysis without making fixes.
**Available Tools**: Bash, Read, Grep, Glob


## Agent Usage with OpenCode

These specialized agents can be referenced in your OpenCode conversations:
- Mention the agent name when you need specialized functionality
- Reference the agent's purpose to get contextually appropriate responses
- The agents follow Agent OS standards and workflows automatically
